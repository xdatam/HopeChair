Lidar and Radar system for Electric Wheelchair
My name is Datam, I am a computer hardware engineer, i am very limited in movement due to a diagnosis of cancer and recently MS.
I am using an electric wheelchair to move indoors and outdoor most of the time, and I know how hard will be sometimes to operate an electric wheelchair.
i am trying to develop open source hardware and software that can help people with disadvantages in movement, and help them with Lidar and object detection for an 
electric wheelchair.

Powered wheelchair users encounter barriers to their mobility everyday. 
Entering a building with non barrier-free areas can massively impact a persons mobility related activities. 
There are a few commercial devices and some experimental that can climb stairs using for instance adaptive wheels with joints or caterpillar drive. 
These systems rely on the use for sensing and control. 
For safe automated obstacle crossing, a robust and environment invariant detection of the surrounding is necessary. 
Radar may prove to be a suitable sensor for its capability to handle harsh outdoor environmental conditions.

i try to have Lidar and Radar as input and compute unit will use the input of Radar And Lidar to recognise , avoid the danger while the electric wheelchair moves.
